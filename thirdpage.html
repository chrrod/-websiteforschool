    <p>The Legend of Zelda is a very popular action-adventure game</p>
    <h2><a href = https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-switch/>Breath of the Wild</a> is my favorite game</h1>
    <img src = "image/image/The_Legend_of_Zelda_Breath_of_the_Wild.jpg" alt = "Game logo" title = "Breath of the Wild">
    <p>This game is a very important to the series as it marked the break from a traditional formula, and also greatly opened up the possiblities for open world games</p>
    <p>It is my favorite because I enjoy these changes that allow a truly free game, allowing you to go wherever whenever and encourages exploration.</p>
