    <h1 style="color: #000000; text-shadow: 2px 2px #ff00f2;">My favorite book is <em>Eragon</em> </h1>
    <img src = "image/image/eragon.jpg">
    <p>I enjoy reading <em>Eragon</em> the most because I enjoy how the setting builds up and the way the story is written. It is probably the book I reread the most.</p>
    <h1 style="color: #000000; text-shadow: 2px 2px #ff00f2;">It comes from the  <a href = https://www.amazon.com/Inheritance-4-Book-Paperback-Eragon-Brisingr/dp/0449813223/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1K3IU02J85MT7&dchild=1&keywords=inheritance+cycle&qid=1632839013&sprefix=inheritance%2Caps%2C185&sr=8-1><em>Inheiratance Cycle</em></a> Series</h1>
    <img src = "image/image/Inheritance_Cycle_cover.jpg" alt = "Book cover" title = "Inheiratance Cycle" >
    <p>The genre of this series is fantasy, one of my favorites, and as previously stated it builds up very well, though the ending left a bit to want, which is probably why the author is currently/planning to make a fifth book.</p>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>A summary of the series(taken from the <a href = https://inheritance.fandom.com/wiki/Inheritance_Cycle#:~:text=Eragon%2C%20a%2015%2Dyear%2D,evil%20tyrant%20who%20rules%20Alaga%C3%ABsia.>fandom site</a>) is "Eragon, a 15-year-old farm boy, finds a dragon egg while out hunting in the Spine. When the dragon hatches for him, he takes on the responsibilities of the Dragon Riders and sets out on a quest to avenge his uncle's death by killing the Ra'zac and, eventually, to bring defeat to the evil tyrant who rules AlagaÃ«sia."</p>
    <h3>In terms of how memorable each book is to me, it goes in the order</h2>
    <ul">
        <li style = "font-style: italic;">Eragon</li>
        <li style = "font-style: italic;">Brisingr</li>
        <li style = "font-style: italic;">Inheritance</li>
        <li style = "font-style: italic;">Eldest</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It goes in this order because as previously stated, <em>Eragon</em> is my favorite, next is <em>Brisingr</em> which I feel helped build the story as it came to a close.</p>
    <p>Then comes <em>Inheritance</em>, because while the ending may not have been perfect, I still enjoyed it and it did its job.</p>
    <p>Finally comes Eldest, another good book, just, in my opinion, falling behind the other three.</p>
